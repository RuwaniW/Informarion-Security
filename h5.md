### 1. ***€ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations***
- The text explains how a sender can securely communicate with a receiver.
- It defines plaintext as the original message and describes encryption as the way to hide that message, turning it into ciphertext.
- Decryption is the process of changing ciphertext back into plaintext.
- Some important terms to be known
- **Cryptography**: The practice of securing messages, performed by cryptographers.
- **Cryptanalysis**: The practice of breaking ciphertext, conducted by cryptanalysts.
- **Cryptology**: The combined field of cryptography and cryptanalysis, studied by cryptologists.
- Plaintext can come in different forms, such as text files, images, and audio.
- The text also mentions that some people might prefer using "encipher" and "decipher" instead of "encrypt" and "decrypt" due to cultural sensitivities.

  ### 2. ***Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg***
 - The article explains how to send a secure message over the Internet using PGP encryption with the gpg tool. Encryption ensures privacy, signing prevents tampering, and public keys help establish trust.
 - GNU private guard is gpg is one of the most popular ways to encript the messages
 - The article explains how to use gpg for encryption and signing on the Linux command line
 - Basic Linux command-line knowledge is needed for this.
 - Steps to be followed;
 -   1. ***Setting Up Keys***: Tero and Alice both create their own keypairs using the gpg tool. Tero generates his keys first, then Alice does the same in a separate folder. They exchange their public keys, which are used to encrypt messages. They verify each other's keys by checking a unique code called a fingerprint, ensuring the keys are authentic.
  -  2. ***Sending a Secure Message***: Alice writes a message and encrypts it using Tero’s public key so only he can read it. She also signs the message with her private key to prove it’s really from her. The encrypted message is saved as encrypted.pgp and can be safely sent over the internet.
-    3. ***Receiving and Reading the Message***: Tero receives the encrypted file from Alice and decrypts it with his secret key. This lets him read the message and confirm that it was sent by Alice because her signature is verified.
   - 4. ***Final Steps and Tips***: The summary ends with the successful exchange of secure messages between Alice and Tero. It also offers simple troubleshooting advice, like what to do if there are issues with the keys. This process shows how to use gpg to keep communications private and secure, highlighting the importance of verifying public keys.
