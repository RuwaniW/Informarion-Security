### 1.***â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations***
- The text explains how a sender can securely communicate with a receiver.
- It defines plaintext as the original message and describes encryption as the way to hide that message, turning it into ciphertext.
- Decryption is the process of changing ciphertext back into plaintext.
- Some important terms to be known
- **Cryptography**: The practice of securing messages, performed by cryptographers.
- **Cryptanalysis**: The practice of breaking ciphertext, conducted by cryptanalysts.
- **Cryptology**: The combined field of cryptography and cryptanalysis, studied by cryptologists.
- Plaintext can come in different forms, such as text files, images, and audio.
- The text also mentions that some people might prefer using "encipher" and "decipher" instead of "encrypt" and "decrypt" due to cultural sensitivities.
