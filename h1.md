## Threat Modeling

### Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential security and privacy concerns. It revolves around four key questions

- What are we working on? – Understanding the system or application being analyzed.
- What can go wrong? – Identifying possible threats and vulnerabilities.
- What are we going to do about it? – Implementing measures to mitigate the identified risks.
- Did we do a good enough job? – Evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented solutions.

By answering these questions, threat modeling helps uncover design and implementation issues that may arise during development or throughout the system’s lifecycle. 
The outcome of this process is a clear identification of threats, which can then be addressed.

#### Who Should Consider Threat Modeling?

Anyone concerned about the security and privacy of their systems should engage in threat modeling. It’s an essential practice for safeguarding applications, systems, data, and services.

#### What is the Threat Modeling Manifesto?

The Threat Modeling Manifesto serves as a guide for developing a tailored threat modeling methodology. It helps create secure models to protect various technological assets. The manifesto is grounded in two main components:

> Values: Assessing the importance of different aspects of the system.

> Principles: Establishing fundamental truths about threat modeling.


### Shostack 2022: Welcome to the Worlds Shortest Threat Modeling Course

-Why? - To anticipate problem when its inexpensive to deal with them

-Four questions and best possible answers 

* What are we working on? Collobaration
* What can go wrong? Pay attention to all the possible answers
* What are we going to do about it? Track our work & Risk management
* Did we do a good job? If our participants recommend threat modeling to their collegues then we have done a good job

##### Advantages

- Increased security awareness
- Improve visibility of target of evaluation
- Identify early risk

#### Challenges

- Lack of security knowledge
- Complexity and time consumption
- Limited tools and resources
- Communication and collobarion issues.

### Identifying and Ranking Threats:

Focus: Address "what can go wrong?" based on the system model.

Method: Use STRIDE or other techniques to identify and rank threats.

STRIDE Categories and Examples:

- Spoofing: Violates Authenticity (e.g., stolen authentication token).
- Tampering: Violates Integrity (e.g., unintended database updates).
- Repudiation: Violates Non-repudiability (e.g., log manipulation).
- Information Disclosure: Violates Confidentiality (e.g., data extraction).
- Denial of Service: Violates Availability (e.g., account lockout).
- Elevation of Privileges: Violates Authorization (e.g., tampered JWT).
- Ranking: Prioritize based on likelihood and impact; consider adding fix effort to prioritization.

### Response and Mitigation:

#### Response Options:
- Mitigate: Reduce the likelihood of the threat materializing.
- Eliminate: Remove the feature or component causing the threat.
- Transfer: Shift responsibility to another entity (e.g., customer).
- Accept: Do nothing due to business requirements or constraints.
  
#### Mitigation Strategies:
- Formulate and document actionable requirements.
- Apply at category or individual threat level.
- Use resources like OWASP's ASVS and MITRE's CWE for guidance.

### Darknet Diaries -Episode 145: AXACT

AXACT was a Pakistani firm notorious for its fraudulent practices, particularly in selling counterfeit academic degrees and diplomas. The episode explores how AXACT done a massive scam by producing and vending fake diplomas and degrees, which were falsely presented as genuine academic qualifications. This scheme had a global reach, impacting thousands of people and damaging the integrity of educational institutions while misleading individuals seeking to improve their credentials.

## a) Security Hygiene Best Practices

- All hardware,software and online applications will need to be documented
- Analyze the list of equipment and programs
- Create a common hygiene policy including following
 *** Password changes
 *** Software updates
 *** Hardware updtaes
 *** Mange new installs
 *** Limit users
 *** Backup data
 *** Employ a cyber security frame work

### Threat modeling for online shopping company - EZY Kidz

#### 1. What are we working on?

##### Company Description

EZY Kidz is an online shopping platform specializing in children's clothing and accessories. It caters to parents and guardians seeking high-quality, fashionable, and age-appropriate clothing for kids

###### Assets

- Customer Data: Personal information, payment details, purchase history, and preferences.
- Inventory Management System: Manages product listings, stock levels, and order fulfillment.
- Payment Processing System: Handles secure transactions 
- Employee Data: HR records, payroll, and internal communications.

 ##### Prioritization:

- Customer data and payment processing system are crucial due to the sensitivity of financial and personal information.
- Inventory management and employee data, though important, are secondary to customer-facing systems.

##### Customer Touchpoints:

Website/Mobile App: Customers use these to view products, make purchases, and manage their accounts.
Payment Gateway: For processing transactions securely.
Customer Service: Handles inquiries, returns, and issues.

#### 2. What can Go Wrong?

##### Threat Models Applied: STRIDE

- Spoofing : An attacker impersonates a legitimate user to gain access to sensitive customer data or make fraudulent purchases.
- Tampering: An attacker alters inventory data, potentially leading to incorrect stock levels or order fulfillment issues.
- Repudiation: A fraudulent transaction occurs, and the attacker denies their involvement by manipulating transaction logs.
- Information Disclosure: Unauthorized access to customer payment and personal data through data breaches.
- Denial of Service: An attacker disrupts service by overwhelming the website with requests, leading to downtime and customer dissatisfaction.
- Elevation of Privileges: An attacker gains unauthorized access to admin functions or sensitive data by exploiting vulnerabilities.

##### Prioritization:

High Risk:

- Information Disclosure: High likelihood and high impact. Compromised customer payment information can lead to severe financial and reputational damage.
-Denial of Service: High likelihood during peak shopping times; disrupts business operations and customer trust.

Medium Risk:

-Spoofing: Medium likelihood if user authentication mechanisms are strong but still a concern.
-Tampering: Medium likelihood depending on the security measures for inventory management.

#### 3. What Are We Going to Do About It?

Mitigation Strategies:

###### Mitigate:

-Information Disclosure: Implement strong encryption for payment and personal data, use secure coding practices, and conduct regular vulnerability assessments.
-Denial of Service: Employ DDoS protection services, implement rate limiting, and maintain redundant server setups to ensure high availability.

###### Eliminate:

Tampering: Upgrade legacy systems with modern, secure solutions to avoid tampering vulnerabilities.

###### Transfer:

Spoofing: Utilize third-party authentication services (e.g., multi-factor authentication) to enhance security and reduce risk.

###### Accept:

Repudiation: Accept the risk but improve logging and monitoring to detect and trace fraudulent activities.

#### 4. Did We Do a Good Enough Job?

##### Ongoing Evaluations:

Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits to assess the effectiveness of implemented controls and identify new vulnerabilities.
Penetration Tests: Perform periodic penetration tests to simulate attacks and evaluate the resilience of security measures.
Continuous Threat Modeling: Regularly update the threat model to reflect changes in the system, emerging threats, and evolving business requirements.

##### Process:

Security measures and threat modeling should be considered a continuous process, not a one-time activity. Regular updates and evaluations are necessary to adapt to new threats and system changes.
