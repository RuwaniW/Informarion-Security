## Braiterman et al 2020: Threat modeling manifesto

Threat modeling is a proactive approach to identifying and addressing potential security and privacy concerns. It revolves around four key questions

-What are we working on? – Understanding the system or application being analyzed.
-What can go wrong? – Identifying possible threats and vulnerabilities.
-What are we going to do about it? – Implementing measures to mitigate the identified risks.
-Did we do a good enough job? – Evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented solutions.

By answering these questions, threat modeling helps uncover design and implementation issues that may arise during development or throughout the system’s lifecycle. 
The outcome of this process is a clear identification of threats, which can then be addressed.

###Who Should Consider Threat Modeling?

Anyone concerned about the security and privacy of their systems should engage in threat modeling. It’s an essential practice for safeguarding applications, systems, data, and services.

###What is the Threat Modeling Manifesto?

The Threat Modeling Manifesto serves as a guide for developing a tailored threat modeling methodology. It helps create secure models to protect various technological assets. The manifesto is grounded in two main components:

>Values: Assessing the importance of different aspects of the system.
>Principles: Establishing fundamental truths about threat modeling.
