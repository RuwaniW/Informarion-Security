#### **One-way functions:**

- Easy to compute in one direction (f(x) from x).
- Extremely hard to reverse (compute x from f(x)).
- Example: Smashing a plate is easy, but putting it back together is very difficult.
- No formal proof that one-way functions exist, though many appear to behave this way.
- Not useful for encryption alone, as they are irreversible.

#### **Trapdoor one-way functions:**

- A special type of one-way function with a secret "trapdoor."
- Easy to compute in one direction and hard to reverse without the secret.
- With the trapdoor (secret information), reversing the function becomes easy.
- Example: Disassembling a watch is difficult to reverse unless you have the assembly instructions (trapdoor).

#### **One-way hash function (also known as compression function, message digest, fingerprint, etc.)**

- Converts a variable-length input (pre-image) into a fixed-length output (hash value).
- Ensures fingerprinting of data: the hash value indicates whether a pre-image is likely the same as another.
- Many-to-one mapping means two different inputs can have the same hash (collisions), but a good hash function minimizes this.
 
#### **Properties of a one-way hash function:**
  
- Easy to compute a hash from a pre-image.
- Hard to reverse: cannot generate a pre-image from a given hash.
- Should be collision-free, meaning it's hard to find two pre-images with the same hash value.
