One-way functions:

- Easy to compute in one direction (f(x) from x).
- Extremely hard to reverse (compute x from f(x)).
- Example: Smashing a plate is easy, but putting it back together is very difficult.
- No formal proof that one-way functions exist, though many appear to behave this way.
- Not useful for encryption alone, as they are irreversible.

Trapdoor one-way functions:

- A special type of one-way function with a secret "trapdoor."
- Easy to compute in one direction and hard to reverse without the secret.
- With the trapdoor (secret information), reversing the function becomes easy.
- Example: Disassembling a watch is difficult to reverse unless you have the assembly instructions (trapdoor).
