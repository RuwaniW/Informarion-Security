## x) Read and summerize - OWASP: OWASP 10 2021

### 1) **A01: 2021 - Broken Acess Control**

- Access controls are in place to ensure that users can only access and perform actions based on their assigned permissions.
- It avoid unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits.

  #### **Common Acess Control Vulnarabilities**
  
  - Violating the principle of least privilege, granting access to more users than necessary.
  - bypassing controls via URL manipulation
  - Insecure direct object references, allowing access to another user's account.
  - Insecure API methods


  #### **Prevention**

  - Access control is most effective in trusted server-side code or serverless APIs, where attackers can't alter checks or metadata.
  - Deny access by default, enforce record ownership, and implement mechanisms consistently across the application.
  - Ensure secure file handling, log and monitor access control failures, and limit API access to reduce the impact of automated attacks

### 2) **A01: 2021 - Security Misconfiguaration**

- The application may be vulnerable if it lacks proper security hardening, has misconfigured cloud permissions, or contains unnecessary features like open ports or unused accounts.
- Other risks include unchanged default credentials, revealing error messages, outdated software, and insecure configurations for servers, frameworks, or security headers.

  #### **Prevention**

  - Secure installation processes should include a repeatable hardening process to quickly deploy locked-down environments, ensuring development, QA, and production environments are identical but use different credentials.
  - Minimize the platform by removing unnecessary features, and regularly review configurations, security updates, and cloud storage permissions. Implement a segmented architecture for secure separation between components or tenants, use security headers, and automate the verification of configurations across all environments.


### 3) **A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components**

- You may be vulnerable if you're unaware of the versions of all components you use, including nested dependencies, or if any software or components are outdated or unsupported.
- Failing to regularly scan for vulnerabilities, address updates in a timely manner, or test the compatibility of patches increases exposure to security risks.

 #### **Prevention**
  
- A patch management process should include removing unused components, continuously inventorying software versions, and monitoring for vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency Check.
- Components should be sourced securely, with signed packages preferred.
- Organizations must monitor for unmaintained libraries and consider virtual patches if necessary.
- An ongoing plan for tracking, prioritizing, and applying updates throughout the application's lifecycle is essential.

### 3) **A03:2021 – Injection**

 - An application is vulnerable to attack when user-supplied data is not properly validated or sanitized, dynamic queries are used without parameterization, or hostile data is injected into queries or commands. 
- Common injection types include SQL, NoSQL, OS command, and ORM injection.
- Source code reviews and automated testing (SAST, DAST, IAST) should be used to detect vulnerabilities, with testing integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to catch flaws before deployment.

  #### **Prevention**

  - To prevent injection attacks, keep data separate from commands and queries by using safe APIs or Object Relational Mapping (ORM) tools.
  - While parameterized queries are preferred, be cautious of SQL injection risks with stored procedures that use dynamic queries.
  - Implement positive server-side input validation, and for residual dynamic queries, escape special characters properly.
  -  Additionally, use SQL controls like LIMIT to prevent mass disclosure of records in case of an injection attack.
