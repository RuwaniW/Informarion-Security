## 1) **A01: 2021 -Broken Acess Control**

- Access controls are in place to ensure that users can only access and perform actions based on their assigned permissions.
- It avoid unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits.

  ### **Common Acess Control Vulnarabilities**
  
  - Violating the principle of least privilege, granting access to more users than necessary.
  - bypassing controls via URL manipulation
  - Insecure direct object references, allowing access to another user's account.
  - Insecure API methods


  ### **Prevention**

  - Access control is most effective in trusted server-side code or serverless APIs, where attackers can't alter checks or metadata.
  - Deny access by default, enforce record ownership, and implement mechanisms consistently across the application.
  - Ensure secure file handling, log and monitor access control failures, and limit API access to reduce the impact of automated attacks
