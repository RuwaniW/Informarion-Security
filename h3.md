## 1. **Disobey 2024**
   
   - The topic I have selected from the Disobey 2024 vidoes is " Smoke and Mirror" - How to hide in Microsoft Azure
   - This video explains What preventive conrols we can do and detection controls
   - Microsoft Entra is the primary identity platform for Microsoftâ€™s cloud services, playing a critical role in security and access management.
   - Microsoft Graph activity logs, signing logs and the audit logs are some of the key logging sources for threat detection.
   - Microsoft Graph can tracks any call with the API and abstract information regarding user, request response , processing and logging .
   - APIS such as Azure AD Graph, Ibiza IAM, Provisioning, App Management allow for detailed tracking of access and provisioning activities, offering rich information for security teams to 
     monitor.
   - Azure Machine Leraning (ML) is a platform for teams to make use of ML models as well as intergrates with Azure data services.
   - It allows SQL DB and storage accounts, has seperate studio to manage work spacrs and always good combination for research.
   - Azure ML access data through credential based and Identity based
   - Securing the Azure Environment: Key Strategies

1. *Understand Your Tools:* Knowing the capabilities of Microsoft Entra, Azure ML, and other Azure services is crucial for implementing effective security.
2. *Use Available Logging:* Leverage Microsoft Graph activity logs, signing logs, and audit logs to detect anomalies. Customize logging solutions to match the specific needs of your environment.
3. *Continuously Evaluate Controls:* Regularly assess and update your security controls to ensure they align with evolving threats and the dynamic nature of cloud environments.
