### Quintin 2014: 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

**1. Tor Still Works** : Tor effectively provides anonymity, even though some users can be targeted through specific attacks or mistakes. It hasn't been broken in terms of security.

**2.Tor is Not Just for Criminals**: A wide range of people, including activists and journalists, use Tor for privacy and secure communication. It doesn't mainly help criminals, who have other tools for illegal activities.

**3.No Military Backdoor**: Tor was initially funded by the US Navy, but it is open-source and has been checked by experts, confirming that it has no hidden backdoors.

**4.No One Has Been Prosecuted for Running a Tor Relay**: There have been no known legal cases in the US against people running Tor relays, though legal issues can arise for exit relays.

**5.Tor is Easy to Use**: The Tor Browser Bundle is simple to use and comes pre-set for secure browsing. Tails, a live operating system, can also route internet traffic through Tor.

**6.Tor is Faster Than You Think**: While Tor is slower than regular internet, its speed has improved over time. More relays can make it even faster.

**7.Tor is Not Perfect**: Users can accidentally compromise their anonymity by using Tor incorrectly. Itâ€™s important to use the Tor Browser or Tails and keep software updated.

Overall, Tor is a strong tool for online privacy, and understanding how to use it properly helps users protect their information.

### Shavers & Bair 2016: Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser

- Communication courses focus on effective business and personal interactions but do not cover investigative methods.
- This book teaches how to uncover covert communications and analyze their content through forensic methods.
- The goal is to uncover covert communications using detective work combined with technology and analytical skills.
- Mistakes made by targets in their communication efforts can provide valuable information.
- A single piece of evidence can lead to uncovering an entire network of communications.
- Tor allows anonymous communication online, helping users bypass government censorship and protect privacy.
- While it facilitates legitimate uses, it can also enable criminal activities.
- Developed by the U.S. government in 2002, Tor is now open-source and not controlled by any single entity.
- Privacy experts worldwide contribute to its development.
- Investigators can analyze devices for Tor artifacts or focus on current Tor usage by suspects.
- Analyzing Tor is complex, and some aspects may be unbreakable for non-intelligence investigators.
- Tor routes internet traffic through random relays, applying multiple layers of encryption to protect user identity.
- Each relay strips away one layer of encryption before forwarding the data, making it hard to trace.
- Similar to mailing a letter through several people to keep the sender's identity secret, each relay only knows its immediate predecessor, preserving anonymity.
- Tor exit nodes may be misidentified; for example, an exit node operator could be wrongly associated with illegal activities conducted by users on the network.
- Governments work to deanonymize Tor, but breaks in cases often occur due to suspect mistakes, not by breaking Tor.
- Investigators often lack federal resources for tracking Tor users, especially in non-terror cases.
- The main vulnerability of Tor is the user, as mistakes in customization or allowing scripts/plugins can expose their real IP address.
- Researchers attempt to deanonymize Tor using various methods, such as controlling multiple relays, performing man-in-the-middle attacks, or tracking traffic, but these methods require significant resources.
- Investigators can track suspects by exploiting errors, such as using non-Tor browsers or allowing tracking codes in emails or documents.
- Email or document tracking codes can reveal the suspect's true IP address if opened outside of Tor.
- Network administrators can identify Tor users within internal networks by monitoring access to the Tor network, although they cannot see the content.
- Most investigations are solved through mistakes made by suspects, such as using non-Tor browsers, revealing their true IP address.
