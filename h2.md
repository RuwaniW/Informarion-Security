# x) Summerizing Article: Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains

### Evalution of Cybersecurity Threats
- Early threats involved self-propagating viruses and worms.
- Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) have emerged, focusing on data compromise for economic or military gain.

### Characteristics of APTs
- APTs are sophisticated and manually operated.
- They use targeted, socially-engineered attacks to gain access.
- APTs evade traditional defenses like antivirus software and firewalls.
- They employ advanced tools, customized malware, and zero-day exploits.

### Limitations of Traditional Cybersecurity
- Conventional methods focus on responding after a breach.
- They assume breaches are due to fixable flaws, which does not apply to APTs.
- Traditional defenses are inadequate against APTs.

### Recommended Approach
- Shift to an intelligence-driven, threat-focused defense model.
- Use the "kill chain" concept to analyze intrusions from the adversary's perspective.
- The kill chain model maps each intrusion phase to detection, mitigation, and response strategies

### Benefits of the Kill Chain Approach:
- Disrupts the adversary's progression at any stage to prevent achieving their objectives.
- Helps in developing resilient defenses and prioritizing security investments.
- Provides a structured way to anticipate and mitigate future APT intrusions.

## Kill Chain Model
The paper presents a new intrusion kill chain model to analyze and counteract intrusions effectively.
The kill chain model maps out each phase of an intrusion, helping to identify points where defenses can be implemented.

### Role of Indicators in the Kill Chain Model:

- Indicators are the fundamental elements of intelligence used to describe intrusions objectively.
- Indicators help identify and respond to threats by providing specific information related to an intrusion.
  
#### Types of Indicators:
- Atomic Indicators:Cannot be broken down further while retaining their meaning.
  Examples include IP addresses, email addresses, and vulnerability identifiers.
- Computed Indicators:Derived from data involved in an incident.
  Examples include hash values and regular expressions. 
- Behavioral Indicators:Combine atomic and computed indicators, often qualified by quantity or combinatorial logic.
  Examples include sequences of actions or behaviors, such as a backdoor generating specific network traffic patterns, followed by other activities like replacing files with ones that match certain hash values.
  Indicator Life Cycle:

### Analysts identify indicators through analysis or collaboration.
- Indicators are then integrated into security tools to detect similar activities.
- When matching activities are discovered, further investigation may reveal additional indicators.
- This cycle of discovering, leveraging, and investigating indicators repeats, forming an indicator life cycle.
  
### Challenges in Managing Indicators:

- Tracking the origin and development of indicators can be time-consuming and difficult without adequate tracking mechanisms.
- It is crucial to ensure that indicators are accurate and relevant to the specific threats being analyzed.
- Misapplying indicators to irrelevant threats or benign activities can lead to ineffective or misguided responses.

## Intrusion Kill Chain

A kill chain is a systematic process to target and engage an adversary to achieve specific effects.The paper introduces a kill chain model specific to cyber intrusions, adapted from military doctrine.

### Phases of the Intrusion Kill Chain:

1.**Reconnaissance**
- Research and identification of potential targets.Includes gathering information such as email addresses, social relationships, or specific technologies.
  
2. **Weaponization**
- Combining a remote access trojan with an exploit to create a deliverable payload. Commonly uses data files like PDFs or Microsoft Office documents.
  
3. **Delivery**
- Transmitting the weaponized payload to the target environment.Typical methods include email attachments, compromised websites, and USB drives.
  
4. **Exploitation**
- Triggering the malicious code on the victim's host
- Exploits vulnerabilities in applications, operating systems, or uses social engineering tactics.
  
5. **Installation**
- Installing malware, such as a remote access trojan, to maintain persistent access in the environment.
  
6. **Command and Control (C2)**
- Establishing communication between the compromised system and the attacker’s control server.
- Allows attackers to remotely interact with the victim's system.
  
7. **Actions on Objectives**
- Performing the final actions to achieve the attacker’s goals, such as data exfiltration.
- May also involve compromising additional systems or disrupting data integrity and availability.

### Objective of the Intrusion Kill Chain

- To provide a structured framework that helps in identifying and interrupting various stages of a cyber intrusion.
- Breaking the chain at any phase can thwart the attacker's efforts and prevent them from achieving their objectives.

### Purpose of the Intrusion Kill Chain Model:

- The model becomes actionable when defenders align their defensive capabilities with the specific processes used by adversaries to target the enterprise.
- It allows defenders to measure the performance and effectiveness of their actions and plan investments to address capability gaps.
  
  ## Intrusion Reconstruction

  ### Challenges in Intrusion Detection:
- Most detected intrusions only reveal limited information about one phase.
- Analysts need to uncover more attributes for each phase to maximize defensive options.

### Importance of Analyzing Prior Phases:

- Detection at a certain phase implies that previous phases have already occurred successfully.
- Complete analysis of earlier phases is necessary to take preventative actions against future intrusions.
- Failure to understand and reproduce earlier phases (like the delivery phase) limits the ability to prevent similar attacks.

  ### Strategic Defense Approach:

- Defenders should aim to detect and analyze attacks earlier in the kill chain.
- Implementing defensive actions across all phases of the kill chain is crucial.
- Understanding the full intrusion process allows defenders to anticipate and mitigate attacks, as adversaries often reuse tools and infrastructure.
